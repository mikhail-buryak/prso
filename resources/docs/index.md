# Introduction

A basic version of the server-side registrar of settlement operations

A settlement transactions registrar is a fiscal device (i.e. apparatus) registered with a tax authority or a program
that, when a business entity conducts a settlement transaction with a buyer in cash or a payment card at the place of
settlements, provides fiscal information that is protected from external interference and accessible to tax authorities
data of each transaction by providing the buyer with a paper check or the ability to receive it in electronic form and
sending such data via the http requests to a single database/fiscal server of tax authorities.

<aside>This implementation provides the possibility of fiscalization, return and cancellation of checks, automatic creation of registered entities and local CRUD.</aside>
